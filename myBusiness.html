      <h2> Recruiting soccer players from East Africa to Europe Big Soccer Clubs  </h2> 


     <p>
        It's hard to remember that before we saw superstars like Lionel Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo 
        on the international stage, <br/>
        they were just kids who fell in love with the game 
        and recruited through some process. <br/>
        There are also African players who are successfuly passed the process and 
        joined big European clubs and they are making a lot of money.<br/>

        Mohammed Salah , Samuel E'to , Yaya Toure, Didier Drogba are among them.

        But in east Africa , we have no or few young soccer player's recruiting organization.
        <br/>I have a dream to have one so that young talent 
        of east Africans join big club like the Senegalese internationa, Sadeo Mane playing for <a href="https://www.liverpoolfc.com/"> Liverpool FC</a>
